![Poster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jorger/color-wars/refs/heads/main/poster_color_wars.png)

Color Wars is a fast-paced, real-time strategy game where players compete to take over the entire board using their color. Built with [Rune.ai](https://developers.rune.ai/), the game delivers smooth real-time multiplayer gameplay with automatic matchmaking, state sync, and cheat prevention.


## 🎮 How to Play

* Each player starts with a set of colored circles on the board.
* Click on your circles to increase their dot count by one.
* When a circle reaches 4 dots, it explodes, capturing the four adjacent squares and spreading your color.
* Chain reactions can happen, use them to your advantage to dominate large areas quickly.
* The goal is simple: Fill the entire board with your color before your opponent does.

## 📦 Tech Stack

* React
* Rune.ai (real-time multiplayer engine)
* TypeScript
